Drowsiness Detection using Machine Learning Technique made for my Software Engineering Project Component

# Working
In the project we have used the popular OpenCV package to facilitate the detection of the User's face in the picture clicked through the embedded camera module. Further we use the EAR function to detect the eye aspect ratio and based on the aspect ratio and the dimensions of the segmenteed eye we use a model which checks the value of the ratio against the pre-calculated values, to give the final output declaring whether the user is dorwsy or not.

After clicking the image through the embedded camera module the output would look something like this -

The result will either be **Drowsy** or **Not Drowsy** depending on the image.
